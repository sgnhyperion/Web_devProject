        <p>A wormhole is a hypothetical structure connecting disparate points in spacetime, and is based on a special solution of the Einstein field equations.[1]

            A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both).
            
            Wormholes are consistent with the general theory of relativity, but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen. Many scientists postulate that wormholes are merely projections of a fourth spatial dimension, analogous to how a two-dimensional (2D) being could experience only part of a three-dimensional (3D) object.[2] A well-known analogy of such constructs is provided by the Klein bottle, displaying a hole when rendered in three dimensions but not in four or higher dimensions.
            
            Theoretically, a wormhole might connect extremely long distances such as a billion light-years, or short distances such as a few meters, or different points in time, or even different universes.

            <p>For this particular list, we've decided to highlight some well-known celestial wonders, as well as a few you might not know about. With new discoveries happening all the time, and so much left to explore, the cosmos is never short on beauty and astonishment.Our understanding of the vast expanse of the cosmos is perhaps still in its infancy. Yet thanks to powerful telescopes and some inspired theorising there is already much we can discern about how the universe works and what it contains.</p>

                <h4>Nebula</h4>
                <p>A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova.</p>

                <h4>Infinite Void</h4>
                <p>The infinite void is the single unbounded region surrounding the geometry model. This is the typical region selected when modeling scattering or radiation problems with the Pressure Acoustics, Boundary Elements interface.</p>

                <h4>Wormhole</h4>
                <p>While researchers have never found a wormhole in our universe, scientists often see wormholes described in the solutions to important physics equations. Most prominently, the solutions to the equations behind Einstein's theory of space-time and general relativity include wormholes.</p>

                <h4>Quasars</h4>
                <p>Quasars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), extremely luminous galactic cores where gas and dust falling into a supermassive black hole emit electromagnetic radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
